# Project Description

The Nash equilibrium is the key solution concept in two-player zero-sum games where a positive reward for a player corresponds a negative reward for the other, and vice versa. It has been shown that there is a deep connection between regret minimization in adversarial environments and convergence to Nash equilibria. In this project you should implement basic MAB and counterfactual minimization algorithms in simple normal-form and extensive-form games and analyze their behavior.
